Here's another old tune, written and recorded right after “Gots2bSwift”. Once
again, Travis Orbin is on the drum set rockin' away. The main rhythmic part the
song was stumbled upon while drum programmin'. It goes a little somethin' like
this: 1, 3, 1, 2... repeated over and “filled up” to make it 4/4, similar to a
lot of Meshuggah riffs. Lyrically, it's loosely based on some true stories that
aren't my own, and that's all I can say...


## Lyrics

>I'm an alley cat baby and I'm goin' astray
I ain't no saint best get out of my way
I see these fat cats scammin' and it just don't feel right
Ya better get ready 'cause I'm lookin' to fight
>
'Cause I'm an alley cat baby and I'm goin' astray
I'm an alley cat baby and I'm goin' today
>
I'm an alley cat baby as I walk through the street
A keen observin' undeservin' and I'm feeling complete
I see these hopped up rats runnin' all over town
Untrustin' and disgustin' and I'm bringin' it down
>
I don't feel like gettin' outta bed today
There's nothin' you can do
I missed a test and I think it'd be best if I shank my sorrows for you
I'm gonna shank
I'm going to shank
Shank my sorrows away
I'm gonna shank
I'm going to shank
Shank shank shankin' my sorrows away
>
Time to bring it down alley cat style
