A few months back my good pal Travis Orbin asked if I would play bass on and
mix/produce a song for him, which he composed a few years ago and actually
showed me before he tracked the drums for "Bugz" and "Idiot Christmas" in 2009.
I decided to take the gig since the song's absurdity and uniqueness doesn't end
at its title, and it presented a formidable challengeâ€”the bass. The part Travis
wrote was quite difficult and took a long time to learn, rehearse, and record.
In fact, there's one tiny part that was beyond me and had to be programmed (what
a wimp, eh?), though the rest of the bass is a blend of programmed samples and
real bass. Travis supplied the drums fully-mixed, which only took a little
tweaking to fit with the rest of the instruments, making the mixing job quite a
bit easier. All in all, it was a fun and worthwhile project and I hope to work
on more of Travis' songs in the future. Check out his session video below and be
sure to download the song from his
[bigcartel](http://travisorbin.bigcartel.com/) store.
